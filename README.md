# LED Matrix Projects
Drivers and Stuff for our (RS232 Controlled) LED Matrix

### Perl code (not working) - Stephan Oeste (emzy.de)
First attempt to replace the default software
### Python code - Stefan Triller (stefantriller.de)
Still working code to replace the default software. It's possible to send multi colored text to the LED panel
### Java code - Sven Steenbock (steene.net)
It's not a tool to send text to the panel, but to receive it. Sven managed to completely reverse engineer the old controller of the LED panel and replace it by his own to provide ethernet including DHCP instead of rs232. The software also allows us to send pure text or binary data to the panel.

Code will be provided soon.

## Tools & Games
### LED Snake -  Enno Boland (gottox.de) 
LED Snake is a clone of the good old arcade / nokia game also called Snake. It uses the whole LED panel and also supports levels with walls. The game runs on the local computer, renders the full view and sends it to the panel.
