Structure of Protocol:

Text Data

This is the actual part of the message that includes the message itself
and information on the colors, the fonts, the sizes.

h	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	- - - - - - 	1000	1001



h	Packet header also serves as destination Sign identifier

1	Data Code for LED pixels

7FH: the header for red (for the first frame only)

6FH: the header for green (for the first frame only)

7EH: the header for red (for the middle frames, 0-N frames)

6EH: the header for green (for the middle frames, 0-N frames)

7DH: the header for red (for the last frame only)

6DH: the header for green (for the last frame only)

2	Nil

3 - 10	Nil

11 - 1000	Text data

1001	Pocket end for checking



Command Data

This is the actual part of the message that includes the functions such
as scroll up, scroll down, Time, Animation etc.

h	1	2	3	4	5	6	7	8	9	10	Modes for 1st frame	Modes for 2nd frame	- - - - -
-	1000	1001



h	Packet header also serves as destination Sign identifier

1	Command code (5FH)

2	The total no. of frames for uploading

3	Nil

4	The 1st frame (default=0)

5	The last frame

6	The length of the sign ( = the pixel wide / 8 )

7	The height of the sign ( = the pixel height / 8)

8	Color (1: single color; 2: tricolor)

9	The max. frames for the sign

10	D0=0

11 --	Modes for each frame, each frame contains 6 bytes

1001	Pocket end for checking
